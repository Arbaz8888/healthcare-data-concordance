# Healthcare Data Concordance Assessment

## Overview
This project focuses on assessing and benchmarking the performance of healthcare sites using an R-based analytics pipeline. The concordance assessment evaluates the structure, process, and outcomes of healthcare sites against predefined benchmarks.

## Features
- **Score Normalization**: Standardizing scores across different metrics (structure, process, outcomes) for consistent comparisons.
- **Concordance Scoring**: Calculating an overall concordance score for each site based on a weighted average of normalized metrics.
- **Benchmarking**: Visualizing site performance against established benchmarks to identify areas of excellence and improvement.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `scales`
- **Data Source**: `healthcare_site_data.csv` - A synthetic dataset representing performance metrics of various healthcare sites.

## Project Structure
- **concordance_assessment.R**: Script for normalizing scores and calculating concordance scores.
- **benchmarking.R**: Script for visualizing the benchmarking of healthcare sites.
- **healthcare_site_data.csv**: The dataset used in this project.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all R dependencies are installed (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `scales`).
3. Run `concordance_assessment.R` to calculate concordance scores for each site.
4. Run `benchmarking.R` to visualize the performance of sites against benchmarks.

## Results
The concordance assessment reveals a clear ranking of healthcare sites based on their performance across multiple metrics. The benchmarking visualizations help identify top-performing sites and those needing improvement.

## Future Work
- Incorporate more granular metrics (e.g., patient satisfaction scores) into the concordance assessment.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring of healthcare site performance.
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict future performance trends based on historical data.
